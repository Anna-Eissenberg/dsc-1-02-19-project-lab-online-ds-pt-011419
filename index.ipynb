    "\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform operations on various data types \n",
    "* Use loops to perform iteration \n",
    "* Use conditionals to make programming decisions\n",
    "* Define and use functions \n",
    "* Ingest and parse user input "

    "## Approach \n",
    "\n",
    "* User choose the desired operation. Options 1, 2, 3, 4 are valid options for operations.  \n",
    "* Two numbers are taken and an `if…elif…else` branching is used to execute a particular section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using functions `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()` and `divide()` evaluate respective operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code should handle exceptions and must return **\"invalid input*** when an unexpected character is given in the input (anything other than 1 - 4)."
